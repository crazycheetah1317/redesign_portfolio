          <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>
      </div>

      <div>
          <p>In this assignment, students were tasked with picking one page of a website to analyze based
              on usability and accessibility issues. After identifying an applicable webpage and brainstorming 
              improvements that would address the usability and accessibility issues, students were then
              asked to redesign the page by making low-fidelity wireframes and a high-fidelity prototype to display these changes,
              accompanied by a style guide. Using these designs, students then had to recreate the webpage,
              modeled as close as possible to the final prototype.

        <h1>Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems</h1>
        <p>The website I chose to redesign was Nitro Bar, a cafe with two locations in Newport and one in Providence.
            Click <a href="https://www.thenitrocart.com/home">HERE</a> to see the original page. Upon first glance, the website
            doesn't seem to have too many glaring issues. The website is functional, however, as I explored more, I found the
            navigation and hiearchial structure of the website to be very disorganized. Thus, those are the areas I focused on
            in my redesign process.

            <div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Learnability</h2>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Is it easy to learn for new users?</h3>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When users first click on the link to enter the website, there’s only two buttons that users can select so 
                            it’s unclear whether that screen is the homepage and/or if it leads to other pages (menu, contact us, about, etc).</li>
                        <li>Once the user plays around with the two buttons, they will see that selecting “Merch” will bring them to the 
                            main landing page (second screenshot above). This is misleading because “Merch” doesn’t exclusively lead users to the 
                            shopping page; it opens a new tab with a different interface, almost like a portal into another dimension of the website.</li>
                        <li>When users click on the icon on the top left of the navigation bar, it brings them back to the initial interface (in the screenshot). 
                            This causes a lot of confusion over what the main landing page is and what the purpose of the initial interface is if it doesn’t 
                            serve an important role.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Is it easy to recall what to do for casual users?</h3>
                </div>

                    <ul>
                        <li>On the initial interface, the label of the button being “Merch” can still be misleading.</li>
                        <li>On the supposed "Home" page, there might be confusion over what links go to what pages.</li>
                        <li>Once users know that they are supposed to click on “Merch” to access the rest of the main landing page and navigation bar, 
                            they shouldn’t have an issue remembering what to do for the future, but it would still be more convenient if the website link 
                            brought them directly to the homepage.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div>
                    <h3>Can typical tasks be done quickly for frequent users?</h3>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The navigation bar of the main landing is still disorganized: “Merch” brings the user to the shopping page, which is the second 
                            tab in the navigation bar (“Order Online” is the first tab) whereas the “Home” tab is the fourth element of the navigation bar when 
                            typically the homepage should be the first screen of a website.</li>
                        <li>The buttons and layout on the "Home" page are disorganized too. It's hard to see the buttons that are placed on top of the images.
                            There's also no structure to the way the buttons and pictures are displayed.</li>
                        <li>One major aspect that I think users would want to see on the website is the cafe’s menu. In the current design there’s no link or 
                            picture to a menu.</li>
                        <li>Some of the other links aren't necessarily essential.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div>
                    <h3>Do you agree with the problems detected?</h3>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The detected accessibility problems indicate that the social media buttons at the bottom of the page and there are some suspicious 
                            alternative texts. It shows alerts for 6 suspicious alternative texts, 2 possible headings, and 6 Noscript elements as well as 5 errors:
                            2 empty buttons and 3 empty links. I agree with these problems because as I was exploring the page myself, I found that a few of the links
                            in the navigation bar did not work, and some linked to the same page. There are, however, 9 ARIA labels overall, which I think is a reasonable 
                            amount, given how concise the webpage is.</li>

                        <p>I created wireframes using Balsamiq for three different screen sizes: desktop, tablet, and mobile. The designs for each screen size is slightly 
                            so that the entire webpage can be responsive.

                        <p>Using Figma, I then created high-fidelity prototypes for the same three screen sizes: desktop, tablet, and mobile.
                            I used my Balsamiq wireframes to outline the design of each of my prototypes and followed the visual style guide to make
                            the whole UI come together. These prototypes are what most closely reflect my final product as I used these prototypes
                            to pay attention to how I wanted the structure of my website to look.

                    </h3>
                    <p>My final redesigned website implements many improvements from the original design, including: </p>
                    <ul style="padding-top: 0.75rem; padding-bottom: 0.75rem;">
                        <li>A more organized navigation bar</li>
                        <li>One main landing page</li>
                        <li>A cohesive layout of the landing page containing the most important and eye-catching information</li>
                        <li>Resizing to improve hiearchy</li>
                        <li>Overall a simplistic but more artistic design</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This was one of the very first website I coded from scratch. Because I had the original website to base my own ideas off of, I learned
                        the fundamentals of what it means for a webpage to have a strong hiearchy, consistent styling, and optimal navigation instructions. I enjoyed
                        working through the entire process of creating this website, from the nascent stages of brainstorming strategies to improve the original website 
                        to outlining the strucutre to visualizing the entire interface, I loved the creative trial and error aspect of this project.
